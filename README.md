<h1 color="white"> Hello! (´• ω •`)ﾉ </h1>

Hey there! I'm Brendon, a computer science student studying at the University of British Columbia with a focus on distributed systems, parallel computing, computer graphics and programming languages. 

My interest stems from my passion for live streaming, something that I love to watch in my free time - where problems like latency, sync, networking, video encoding, learned rate-distortion optimization, and robustly distributing content all occur.

I am a full-stack developer with work experience in various fields of software:

* Currently at Arista Networks, I work on network switches on the platform team with a focus on using C++ and Python to develop and support Arista switches on [SONiC]([url](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC)), an open-source network operating system (NOS).
* Previously at Alida, I worked on creating interactive and web-accessible components with React, TypeScript and Jest; I also worked to plan and create the architecture for migrating the frontend application to a new backend API contract, as well as supporting other backend-related features using C# and JavaScript.
* At Kai Shing Management Services Limited, I worked on eliminating manual workflows for building operations and improving tenant experience by creating dashboards, mini-features and data pipelines to expose more usable data for business analytics & logistics operations with Java, Python, Spring Boot & SQL.
* In my academic terms at UBC, I worked as a UTA for computer science courses. Aligning with my interests in computer systems, I was previously a TA for CPSC 213 & CPSC 121, both of which are courses covering low-level concepts such as computer systems, digital circuits, discrete mathematics & proofs. 

In my free time, I like to play the guitar, look at keyboards I can't afford, learn Japanese (i.e. watch VTubers) and play video games - especially FPS and Rhythm games (maimai!!). I also like to apply the knowledge I've learned in classes to my interests, so I occasionally do game development and work on mini projects/tooling on the side.  

I'm currently looking for cool projects that are related to my interests, internship (starting W24/S24) and fulltime (S24) roles.

Thanks for reading my blurb! For academic/career opportunities or projects - or if you want to talk rhythm games/VTubers, please!! reach out through my [**email**](mailto:contact@brendontsim.com) - I'd love to chat!
