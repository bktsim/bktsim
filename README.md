<h1 color="white"> Hello! (´• ω •`)ﾉ </h1>

Hey there! I'm Brendon, a computer science student studying at the University of British Columbia focusing on distributed systems, computer networking, multimedia content distribution (primarily distribution, but also image/video processing, compression, and evaluation) and machine learning. 

My interest stems from my passion for live streaming, something that I love. Problems related to networking (latency, sync) & distributed systems (content distribution) problems all occur in this space, which is why I chose to focus on those fields and those adjacent to them. I'm interested in helping everyone become more connected in this world that is growing to be increasingly remote through improving real-time systems. Especially with live streaming - I want to improve the live streaming space for both the streamers and the viewers!

I also hold a deep interest in the following topics:
* Operating Systems
* NLP (especially speech and information retrieval-related applications - I wrote a [summary on ASR correction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iPgyrDBmj3awBQ9RytPWcZsDSxXprcXKRqxp7omErec/edit?usp=sharing) and a [summary on a TREC paper](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jR_41FI9ZrhCdlEDEIohjRUwaW2J_JcsCoGeQn1oD7s/edit?usp=sharing) for IR on my exchange and found both of them to be super cool!)
* Computer Vision, and
* Computer Graphics.

I am a full-stack developer with work experience in various fields of software across different industries:

* Currently at Arista Networks, I work on network switches on the platform team with a focus on supporting Arista switches on [SONiC]([url](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC)), an open-source network operating system (NOS) using C++ and Python.
* Previously at Alida, I worked on creating interactive and web-accessible components with React, TypeScript and Jest with a mobile-first focus; I also worked to plan and create the architecture for migrating the frontend application to a new backend API contract, as well as supporting other backend-related features using C# and JavaScript.
* At Kai Shing Management Services Limited, I worked on eliminating manual workflows for building operations and improving tenant experience by creating dashboards, mini-features and data pipelines to expose more usable data for business analytics & logistics operations with Java, Python, Spring Boot & SQL.
* In my academic terms at UBC, I worked as a UTA for computer science courses. Aligning with my interests in computer systems, I was previously a TA for CPSC 213 & CPSC 121, both of which are courses covering low-level concepts such as computer systems, digital circuits, discrete mathematics & proofs. I'm slated to TA for CPSC 313 for the coming term (2023W2). 

In my free time, I like to play the guitar, look at keyboards I can't afford, learn Japanese (i.e. watch VTubers) and play video games - especially FPS and Rhythm games (maimai). I also like to apply the knowledge I've learned in classes to my interests, so I occasionally do game development and work on mini projects/tooling on the side.  

I'm currently looking for cool projects that are related to my interests, internships and full-time roles. I can speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese, so any role that requires the use of more than one language would be a nice plus.

Thanks for reading my long blurb! For academic/career opportunities or projects - or if you want to talk rhythm games/VTubers, please reach out through my [**email**](mailto:contact@brendontsim.com) - I'd love to chat!
