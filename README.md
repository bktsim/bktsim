## Hello! (´• ω •`)ﾉ  
Hey there! I'm Brendon, a computer science student studying at the University of British Columbia with a focus on distributed systems, parallel computing and programming languages.

* In my academic terms at UBC, I work as an UTA for computer science courses. I was previously a TA for CPSC 213 & CPSC 121, both of which are courses covering low-level concepts such as computer systems, digital circuits, discrete mathematics & proofs. 
* Most recently with Alida on the Surveys team, I created new interactive and web-accessible question types as a part of the Q2 update with React, TypeScript and unit tests with Jest for customers to use in their Surveys. Notably, I also planned, led and setup the architecture for migrating the frontend to a new backend API contract whilst ensuring backwards compatability. 
* With Kai Shing Management Services Limited, I worked on eliminating manual workflows for building operations & improving tenant experience by creating dashboards, improving various services & data pipelines with Java, Python, Spring Boot & SQL.

In my free time, I like to play guitar, look at keyboards I can't afford, learn Japanese (watch VTubers!) and play video games (all kinds - but especially FPS and Rhythm games!). I like to apply knowledge I've learned in classes to my interests, so I ocassionally do game development and work on mini projects/tooling on the side.  

For academic, career opportunities or other enquiries, please reach out through my email (at my website).

I am interested in using my Japanese in a part time job, especially if it is related to VTubers. If you have a job that I might qualify for, please reach out!

特にVTuberと関わりがあり、日本語力が活かせる仕事をアルバイトかボランティアの形でやってみたいです。もしよかったら、私の個人サイトのメールまでご連絡くださいますようお願い申し上げます。
