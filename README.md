<h1 color="white"> Hello! (´• ω •`)ﾉ </h1>

Hey there! I'm Brendon, a computer science student studying at the University of British Columbia with a focus on distributed systems, parallel computing, computer networking, and machine learning. My interest stems from my passion for live streaming - something that I watch every day. Problems related to networking and distributed systems frequently occur in this space.

Accompanying my computing interests, I am also adjacently interested in the following topics:
* Operating Systems
* NLP (esp. speech and information retrieval-related applications), and
* Computer Vision.

I am a full stack developer with work experience in various fields of software across different industries:

* At Arista Networks, I worked on adding support for multi-asic devices, new tests & test infrastructure based on prior customer escalations, and prototypes of new features for [SONiC]([url](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC)), an open-source network operating system (NOS) with C++ and Python.
* At Alida, I created interactive and WCAG-compliant web-accessible components with React, TypeScript and Jest; Owned the architecture for migrating the frontend to a new backend API, and worked on product features using C# and JavaScript.
* At Kai Shing, I eliminated manual workflows for building operations and improving tenant experience by creating dashboards, adding features and data pipelines to expose more data for business analytics & logistics with Java, Python, Spring Boot & SQL.
* At UBC, I work as a teaching assistant for computer science courses covering low-level concepts. I'm currently TAing CPSC 313, and was previously a TA for CPSC 213 & CPSC 121, covering computer systems, digital circuits, discrete mathematics & proofs. 

In my free time, I like playing the guitar, looking at keyboards I can't afford, learning Japanese (i.e. watching VTubers) and playing video games - especially FPS and Rhythm games (maimai). I also like to apply the knowledge I've learned in classes to my interests through game development making tooling that increases my quality of life.

I'm on the lookout for cool projects that are related to my interests and full-time roles in Canada, USA, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong. I can speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese, so any role using more than one language would be a cool plus!
