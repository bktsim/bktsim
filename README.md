<h1 color="white"> Hello! (´• ω •`)ﾉ </h1>

Hey there! I'm Brendon, a computer science student studying at the University of British Columbia with a focus on distributed systems, computer networking, image information (media encoding, image processing) and machine learning. 

My interest stems from my passion for live streaming, something that I love. Problems related to networking (latency, sync), video encoding, and distributed computing problems all occur in this space, which is why I chose to focus on those fields and those adjacent to them. I hope to improve the live streaming space for both the streamers and the viewers - especially for VTubers!

I also hold a deep interest in the following topics:
* Operating Systems
* NLP (especially speech and information retrieval-related applications - I wrote a [summary on ASR correction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iPgyrDBmj3awBQ9RytPWcZsDSxXprcXKRqxp7omErec/edit?usp=sharing) and a [summary on a TREC paper](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jR_41FI9ZrhCdlEDEIohjRUwaW2J_JcsCoGeQn1oD7s/edit?usp=sharing) for IR on my exchange and found both of them to be super cool!)
* Computer Vision, and
* Computer Graphics.

I know I'm greedy, but I can't help it. They're all super cool, powerful and useful topics.

I am a full-stack developer with work experience in various fields of software across different industries:

* Currently at Arista Networks, I work on network switches on the platform team with a focus on using C++ and Python to develop and support Arista switches on [SONiC]([url](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC)), an open-source network operating system (NOS).
* Previously at Alida, I worked on creating interactive and web-accessible components with React, TypeScript and Jest; I also worked to plan and create the architecture for migrating the frontend application to a new backend API contract, as well as supporting other backend-related features using C# and JavaScript.
* At Kai Shing Management Services Limited, I worked on eliminating manual workflows for building operations and improving tenant experience by creating dashboards, mini-features and data pipelines to expose more usable data for business analytics & logistics operations with Java, Python, Spring Boot & SQL.
* In my academic terms at UBC, I worked as a UTA for computer science courses. Aligning with my interests in computer systems, I was previously a TA for CPSC 213 & CPSC 121, both of which are courses covering low-level concepts such as computer systems, digital circuits, discrete mathematics & proofs. 

In my free time, I like to play the guitar, look at keyboards I can't afford, learn Japanese (i.e. watch VTubers: the main reason why I'm learning computer vision & computer graphics) and play video games - especially FPS and Rhythm games (maimai!). I also like to apply the knowledge I've learned in classes to my interests, so I occasionally do game development and work on mini projects/tooling on the side.  

I'm currently looking for cool projects that are related to my interests and full-time (S24) roles. Any role that requires the use of more than one language would be a nice plus! (I can speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese!)

Thanks for reading my long blurb! For academic/career opportunities or projects - or if you want to talk rhythm games/VTubers, please reach out through my [**email**](mailto:contact@brendontsim.com) - I'd love to chat!
