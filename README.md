## Hello! (´• ω •`)ﾉ  
Hey there! I'm Brendon, a computer science student studying at the University of British Columbia with a focus on distributed systems, parallel computing and programming languages.

* In my academic terms at UBC, I work as a UTA for computer science courses. I was previously a TA for CPSC 213 & CPSC 121, both of which are courses covering low-level concepts such as computer systems, digital circuits, discrete mathematics & proofs. 
* Most recently with Alida on the Surveys team, I created new interactive and web-accessible question types as a part of the Q2 update with React, TypeScript and unit tests with Jest for customers to use in their Surveys. Notably, I also planned, led and set up the architecture for migrating the frontend to a new backend API contract whilst ensuring backwards compatibility. 
* With Kai Shing Management Services Limited, I worked on eliminating manual workflows for building operations & improving tenant experience by creating dashboards and improving various services & data pipelines with Java, Python, Spring Boot & SQL.

In my free time, I like to play the guitar, look at keyboards I can't afford, learn Japanese (i.e. watch VTubers) and play video games - especially FPS and Rhythm games. I also like to apply the knowledge I've learned in classes to my interests, so I occasionally do game development and work on mini projects/tooling on the side.
