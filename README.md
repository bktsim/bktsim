<h1 color="white"> Hello! (´• ω •`)ﾉ </h1>

Hey there! I'm Brendon, a computer science student studying at the University of British Columbia focusing on distributed systems, computer networking, multimedia content distribution (primarily distribution, but also image/video processing, compression, and evaluation) and machine learning. 

My interest stems from my passion for live streaming - something that I watch everyday. Problems related to networking (latency, sync) & distributed systems (content distribution) problems all occur in this space.

I am also interested in the following topics:
* Operating Systems
* NLP (esp. speech and information retrieval-related applications - I wrote a [summary on ASR correction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iPgyrDBmj3awBQ9RytPWcZsDSxXprcXKRqxp7omErec/edit?usp=sharing) and a [summary on a TREC paper](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jR_41FI9ZrhCdlEDEIohjRUwaW2J_JcsCoGeQn1oD7s/edit?usp=sharing) for IR on my exchange @ Waseda)
* Computer Vision, and
* Computer Graphics.

I am a full-stack developer with work experience in various fields of software across different industries:

* At Arista Networks, I worked on adding support for multi-asic devices, new tests & test infrastructure based on customer escalations, and prototypes of new features for [SONiC]([url](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC)), an open-source network operating system (NOS) with C++ and Python.
* Previously at Alida, I created interactive and WCAG-compliant web-accessible components with React, TypeScript and Jest; Owned the architecture for migrating the frontend application to a new backend API, and worked on product features using C# and JavaScript.
* At Kai Shing, I eliminated manual workflows for building operations and improving tenant experience by creating dashboards, adding features and data pipelines to expose more usable data for business analytics & logistics with Java, Python, Spring Boot & SQL.
* In school at UBC, I work as a UTA for computer science courses. I'm TAing CPSC 313 for 2023W2, and was previously a TA for CPSC 213 & CPSC 121, both of which are courses covering low-level concepts such as computer systems, digital circuits, discrete mathematics & proofs. 

In my free time, I like playing the guitar, looking at keyboards I can't afford, learning Japanese (i.e., watching VTubers) and playing video games - especially FPS and Rhythm games (maimai). I also like to apply the knowledge I've learned in classes to my interests, so I occasionally do game development and work on mini-projects and convenient tooling on the side.  

I'm on the lookout for cool projects that are related to my interests and full-time roles. I can speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese, so any role that requires the use of more than one language would be a cool plus.

Thanks for reading my long blurb! For academic/career opportunities or projects - or if you want to talk rhythm games/VTubers, please reach out through my [**email**](mailto:contact@brendontsim.com) - I'd love to chat!
