Hi! I’m Brendon, a computer science student at the University of British Columbia. My interests in computing lie in programming languages, distributed computing and machine learning. 

I am currently a teaching assistant for CPSC 213, UBC’s introduction to computer systems. I am also a full stack developer with experience in various technological stacks in my previous internships. 

* Most recently at Alida on the surveys team, I created interactive, accessible and WCAG compliant components with React in TypeScript with its accompanying unit tests to modernise the Surveys’ application. I also helped set up architecture to migrate the frontend service to a new backend API contract and debugged various bugs throughout the application in C# and JavaScript.
* In the past with Kai Shing Management Services Limited, I worked on improving workflows for building operations by creating dashboards, backend services & improving data pipelines for API endpoints with Java, Python & C#. 
* I was also previously a teaching assistant for CPSC 121, UBC’s introduction to discrete mathematics, circuits and proofs.

In my free time, I like to play the guitar, look at keyboards I can’t afford and learn Japanese. I also like to apply knowledge I learned to my interests, such as game development & working on live-streaming related technologies.

Currently looking for Fall 2023 co-op opportunities. For academic, career opportunities or other enquires, please reach out through my email, which you can locate at my website (brendontsim.com).
