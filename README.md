<h1 color="white"> Hello! (´• ω •`)ﾉ </h1>

Hey there! I'm Brendon, a computer science graduate from the University of British Columbia. I'm most interested in distributed systems, computer networking and machine learning. The list goes on and it's hard to pick, but long story short, I like making lots of things go fast in a reliable manner using whatever means possible. When I was at UBC, I was a teaching assistant (1yr) for UBC's courses on computer architecture, operating systems, discrete maths and proofs.

I'm a full-stack developer with work experience in various fields of software across different industries (1.3yrs internships), having experience in full-stack, frontend, backend, IoT, embedded, game-dev and more. 
* Arista Networks: Added support for multi-asic devices, new tests & test infrastructure based on prior customer escalations, and prototypes of new features for [SONiC]([url](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC)), an open-source network operating system (NOS) with C++ and Python.
* Alida: Created interactive and WCAG-compliant web-accessible components with React, TypeScript and Jest; Owned the architecture for migrating the frontend to a new backend API, and worked on product features using C# and JavaScript.
* Kai Shing: Eliminated manual workflows for building operations & improved tenant experience by creating dashboards, adding features and data pipelines to expose more data for business analytics & logistics with Java, Python, Spring Boot & SQL.

In my free time, I like playing the guitar, looking at keyboards I can't afford, learning Japanese (i.e. watching VTubers) and playing video games - especially FPS and Rhythm games (maimai). I also like to apply the knowledge I've learned in classes to my interests through game development making tooling that increases my quality of life.

I'm on the lookout for cool projects that are related to my interests and full-time roles in Canada, USA, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong. I can speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese, so any role using more than one language would be a cool plus!
